General types of Logic

1. Transform certain objects.
2. AND, OR, XOR, etc. between two objects.
3. Symmetry filling.
4. Create new objects.
5. Delete objects.
6. Grow (maybe Retract) with barriers.
7. Code: Output object signifies something in Input.

All of the above can also happen within a Grid

There are Tasks where the IF checks happen on objects after a certain number of transformations!


Object Relationships that must be encoded:

1. In
2. Out
3. Through
4. Right
5. Left
6. Over
7. Under
8. Touching
9. Overlapping
10. Underlapping
11. Along X
12. Along Y
13. Along XY diagonal
14. Along -XY diagonal
15. Lego: Smaller objects can generate a larger one, e.g. four Corners can signify a Parallelogram, or identical objects can act as Pixels of a larger one.
