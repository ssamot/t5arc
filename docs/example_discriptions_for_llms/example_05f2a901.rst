The Example has 3 pairs of Input- Output Canvasses.

Pair 1.
Input Canvas has size [9, 14]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [0, 10], colour = 3, dimensions = [4, 3])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [3, 2], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

Output Canvas has size [9, 14]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [0, 4], colour = 3, dimensions = [4, 3])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [3, 2], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

The random Object also has a transformation: Translate(distance = [0, -6]).


Pair 2
Input Canvas has size [10, 9]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [0, 4], colour = 3, dimensions = [3, 4])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [6, 3], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

Output Canvas has size [10, 9]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [3, 4], colour = 3, dimensions = [3, 4])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [3, 4], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

The random Object also has a transformation: Translate(distance = [3, 0]).


Pair 3
Input Canvas has size [10, 11]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [1, 2], colour = 3, dimensions = [5, 3])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [3, 8], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

Output Canvas has size [10, 11]
It has two Objects:
random = Random(canvas_pos = [1, 5], colour = 3, dimensions = [3, 4])
box = Parallelogram(canvas_pos = [3, 8], colour = 9, dimensions = [2, 2])

The random Object also has a transformation: Translate(distance = [0, 3]).
